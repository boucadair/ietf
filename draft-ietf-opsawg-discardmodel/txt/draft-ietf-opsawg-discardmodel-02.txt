           An Information Model for Packet Discard Reporting
                   draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel-02

Abstract

   The primary function of a network is to transport packets and deliver
   them according to a service level objective.  Understanding both
   where and why packet loss occurs within a network is essential for
   effective network operation.  Device-reported packet loss is the most
   direct signal for network operations to identify customer impact
   resulting from unintended packet loss.  This document defines an
   information model for packet loss reporting, which classifies these
   signals to enable automated network mitigation of unintended packet
   loss.

1.  Introduction

   In automating network operations, a network operator needs to be able
   to detect anomalous packet loss, diagnose or root cause the loss, and
   then apply one of a set of possible actions to mitigate customer-
   impacting packet loss.  Some packet loss is normal or intended in IP
   networks, however.  Hence, precise classification of packet loss
   signals is crucial both to ensure that anomalous packet loss is
   easily detected and that the right action or sequence of actions are
   taken to mitigate the impact, as taking the wrong action can make
   problems worse.

   The existing metrics for reporting packet loss, as defined in
   [RFC1213] - namely ifInDiscards, ifOutDiscards, ifInErrors,
   ifOutErrors - do not provide sufficient precision to automatically
   identify the cause of the loss and mitigate the impact.  From a
   network operator's perspective, ifInDiscards can represent both

   intended packet loss (e.g., packets discarded due to policy) and
   unintended packet loss (e.g., packets dropped in error).
   Furthermore, these definitions are ambiguous, as vendors can and have
   implemented them differently.  In some implementations, ifInErrors
   accounts only for errored packets that are dropped, while in others,
   it accounts for all errored packets, whether they are dropped or not.
   Many implementations support more discard metrics than these; where
   they do, they have been inconsistently implemented due to the lack of
   a standardised classification scheme and clear semantics for packet
   loss reporting.  [RFC7270] provides support for reporting discards
   per flow in IPFIX using forwardingStatus, however, the defined drop
   reason codes also lack sufficient clarity to support automated root
   cause analysis and mitigation of impact.

   Hence, this document defines an information model for packet loss
   reporting, aiming to address these issues by presenting a packet loss
   classification scheme that can enable automated mitigation of
   unintended packet loss.  Consistent with [RFC3444], this information
   model is independent of any specific implementations or protocols
   used to transport the data.  There are multiple ways that this
   information model could be implemented (i.e., data models), including
   SNMP [RFC1157], NETCONF [RFC6241] / YANG [RFC7950], and IPFIX
   [RFC5153], but they are outside of the scope of this document.  We
   further limit the scope of this document to reporting packet loss at
   layer 3 and frames discarded at layer 2, although the information
   model could be extended in future to cover segments dropped at layer
   4.

   Section 3 describes the problem.  Section 4 describes the information
   model and requirements with examples.  Section 5 provides examples of
   discard signal-to-cause-to-auto-mitigation action mapping.  Section 6
   presents the information model as an abstract data structure in YANG,
   in accordance with [RFC8791].  Appendix A provides an example of
   where packets may be discarded in a device.  Appendix B details the
   authors' experience from implementing this model.

   This document considers only the signals that may trigger automated
   mitigation plans and not how they are defined or executed.

   A packet discard is considered to be any packet dropped by a device,
   which may be intentional (i.e. due to a configured policy, e.g. such
   as an Access Control List (ACL)) or unintentional (i.e. packets
   dropped in error).

3.  Problem Statement

   At the highest-level, unintended packet loss is the discarding of
   packets that the network operator otherwise intends to deliver, i.e.
   which indicates an error state.  There are many possible reasons for
   unintended packet loss, including: erroring links may corrupt packets
   in transit; incorrect routing tables may result in packets being
   dropped because they do not match a valid route; configuration errors
   may result in a valid packet incorrectly matching an access control
   list (ACL) and being dropped.  Whilst the specific definition of
   unintended packet loss is network dependent, for any network there
   are a small set of potential actions that can be taken to minimise
   customer impact by auto-mitigating unintended packet loss:

   1.  Take a device, link, or set of devices and/or links out of
       service.

   2.  Return a device, link, or set of devices and/or links back into
       service.

   3.  Move traffic to other links or devices.

   4.  Roll back a recent change to a device that might have caused the
       problem.

   5.  Escalate to a human (e.g., network operator) as a last resort.

   A precise signal of impact is crucial, as taking the wrong action can
   be worse than taking no action.  For example, taking a congested
   device out of service can make congestion worse by moving the traffic
   to other links or devices, which are already congested.

   To detect whether device-reported discards indicate a problem and to
   determine what actions should be taken to mitigate the impact and
   remediate the cause, depends on four primary features of the packet
   loss signal:

   1.  The cause of the loss.

   2.  The rate and/or degree of the loss.

   3.  The duration of the loss.

Internet-Draft    Info. Model for Pkt Discard Reporting        July 2024


   4.  The location of the loss.

   Features 2, 3, and 4 are already addressed with passive monitoring
   statistics, for example, obtained with SNMP [RFC1157] / MIB-II
   [RFC1213] or NETCONF [RFC6241] / YANG [RFC7950].  Feature 1, however,
   is dependent on the classification scheme used for packet loss
   reporting.  In the next section, we define a new classification
   scheme to address this problem.

4.  Information Model

   The classification scheme is defined as a tree, which follows the
   structure component/direction/type/layer/sub-type/sub-sub-
   type/.../metric, where:
   a. component can be interface|device|control_plane|flow
   b. direction can be ingress|egress
   c. type can be traffic|discards, where traffic accounts for packets
   successfully received or transmitted, and discards accounts for
   packet drops
   d. layer can be l2|l3

   For additional context, Appendix A provides an example of where
   packets may be discarded in a device.

4.1.  Requirements

   Requirements 1-10 relate to packets forwarded by the device;
   requirement 11 relates to packets destined to or from the device:

   1.   All instances of frame or packet receipt, transmission, and
        discards MUST be reported.

   2.   All instances of frame or packet receipt, transmission, and
        discards SHOULD be attributed to the physical or logical
        interface of the device where they occur.

   3.   An individual frame MUST only be accounted for by either the L2
        traffic class or the L2 discard classes within a single
        direction, i.e., ingress or egress.

   4.   An individual packet MUST only be accounted for by either the L3
        traffic class or the L3 discard classes within a single
        direction, i.e., ingress or egress.

   5.   A frame accounted for at L2 SHOULD NOT be accounted for at L3
        and vice versa.  An implementation MUST expose which layers a
        discard is counted against.

   6.   The aggregate L2 and L3 traffic and discard classes SHOULD
        account for all underlying packets received, transmitted, and
        discarded across all other classes.

   7.   The aggregate Quality of Service (QoS) traffic and no buffer
        discard classes MUST account for all underlying packets
        received, transmitted, and discarded across all other classes.

   8.   In addition to the L2 and L3 aggregate classes, an individual
        discarded packet MUST only account against a single error,
        policy, or no_buffer discard subclass.

   9.   When there are multiple reasons for discarding a packet, the
        ordering of discard class reporting MUST be defined.

Internet-Draft    Info. Model for Pkt Discard Reporting        July 2024


   10.  If Diffserv [RFC2475] is not used, no_buffer discards SHOULD be
        reported as class0.

   11.  Traffic to the device control plane has its own class, however,
        traffic from the device control plane SHOULD be accounted for in
        the same way as other egress traffic.

4.2.  Examples

   Assuming all the requirements are met, a "good" unicast IPv4 packet
   received would increment:
   - interface/ingress/traffic/l3/v4/unicast/packets
   - interface/ingress/traffic/l3/v4/unicast/bytes
   - interface/ingress/traffic/qos/class_0/packets
   - interface/ingress/traffic/qos/class_0/bytes

   A received unicast IPv6 packet discarded due to Hop Limit expiry
   would increment:
   - interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/unicast/packets
   - interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/unicast/bytes
   - interface/ingress/discards/l3/rx/ttl_expired/packets

   An IPv4 packet discarded on egress due to no buffers would increment:
   - interface/egress/discards/l3/v4/unicast/packets
   - interface/egress/discards/l3/v4/unicast/bytes
   - interface/egress/discards/no_buffer/class_0/packets
   - interface/egress/discards/no_buffer/class_0/bytes

5.  Example Signal-Cause-Mitigation Mapping

   Figure 1 gives an example discard signal-to-cause-to-mitigation
   action mapping.  Mappings for a specific network will be dependent on
   the definition of unintended packet loss for that network.

A.1.  Discard Class Descriptions

   discards/policy/:  These are intended discards, meaning packets
      dropped by a device due to a configured policy.  There are
      multiple sub-classes.

   discards/error/l2/rx/:  Frames discarded due to errors in the
      received L2 frame.  There are multiple sub-classes, such as those
      resulting from failing CRC, invalid header, invalid MAC address,
      or invalid VLAN.

   discards/error/l3/rx/:  These are discards which occur due to errors
      in the received packet, indicating an upstream problem rather than
      an issue with the device dropping the errored packets.  There are
      multiple sub-classes, including header checksum errors, MTU
      exceeded, and invalid packet, i.e. due to incorrect version,
      incorrect header length, or invalid options.

   discards/error/l3/rx/ttl_expired:  There can be multiple causes for

      TTL-expired (or Hop limit exceeded) discards: i) trace-route; ii)
      TTL (Hop limit) set too low by the end-system; iii) routing loops.

   discards/error/l3/no_route/:  Discards occur due to a packet not
      matching any route.

   discards/error/local/:  A device may discard packets within its
      switching pipeline due to internal errors, such as parity errors.
      Any errored discards not explicitly assigned to the above classes
      are also accounted for here.

   discards/no_buffer/:  Discards occur due to no available buffer to
      enqueue the packet.  These can be tail-drop discards or due to an
      active queue management algorithm, such as RED [RED93] or CODEL
      [RFC8289].

Appendix B.  Implementation Experience

   This appendix captures the authors' experience gained from
   implementing and applying this information model across multiple
   vendors' platforms, as guidance for future implementers.

   1.   The number and granularity of classes described in Section 3
        represent a compromise.  It aims to offer sufficient detail to
        enable appropriate automated actions while avoiding excessive
        detail, which may hinder quick problem identification.
        Additionally, it helps constrain the quantity of data produced
        per interface to constrain data volume and device CPU impacts.
        Although further granularity is possible, the scheme described
        has generally proven to be sufficient for the task of auto-
        mitigating unintended packet loss.

   2.   There are multiple possible ways to define the discard
        classification tree.  For example, we could have used a multi-
        rooted tree, rooted in each protocol.  Instead, we opted to
        define a tree where protocol discards and causal discards are
        accounted for orthogonally.  This decision reduces the number of
        combinations of classes and has proven sufficient for
        determining mitigation actions.

   3.   NoBuffer discards can be realized differently with different
        memory architectures.  Whether a NoBuffer discard is attributed
        to ingress or egress can differ accordingly.  For successful
        auto-mitigation, discards due to egress interface congestion
        should be reported on egress, while discards due to device-level
        congestion (e.g. due to exceeding the device forwarding rate)
        should be reported on ingress.

   4.   Platforms often account for the number of packets discarded
        where the TTL has expired (or Hop Limit exceeded), and the
        device CPU has returned an ICMP Time Exceeded message.  There is
        typically a policer applied to limit the number of packets sent
        to the device CPU, however, which implicitly limits the rate of
        TTL discards that are processed.  One method to account for all
        packet discards due to TTL expired, even those that are dropped
        by a policer when being forwarded to the CPU, is to use
        accounting of all ingress packets received with TTL=1.

   5.   Where no route discards are implemented with a default null
        route, separate discard accounting is required for any explicit
        null routes configured, in order to differentiate between
        interface/ingress/discards/policy/null_route/packets and
        interface/ingress/discards/errors/no_route/packets.

   6.   It is useful to account separately for transit packets discarded
        by transit ACLs or policers, and packets discarded by ACLs or
        policers which limit the number of packets to the device control
        plane.

   7.   It is not possible to identify a configuration error - e.g.,
        when intended discards are unintended - with device packet loss
        metrics alone.  For example, to determine if ACL drops are
        intended or due to a misconfigured ACL some other method is
        needed, i.e., with configuration validation before deployment or
        by detecting a significant change in ACL drops after a
        configuration change compared to before.

   8.   Where traffic byte counters need to be 64-bit, packet and
        discard counters that increase at a lower rate may be encoded in
        fewer bits, e.g., 48-bit.

   9.   Aggregate counters need to be able to deal with the possibility
        of discontinuities in the underlying counters.

   10.  In cases where the reporting device is the source or destination
        of a tunnel, the ingress protocol for a packet may differ from
        the egress protocol; if IPv4 is tunneled over IPv6 for example.
        Some implementations may attribute egress discards to the
        ingress protocol.

   11.  While the classification tree is seven layers deep, a minimal
        implementation may only implement the top six layers.
